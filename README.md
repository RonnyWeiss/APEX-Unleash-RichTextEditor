This plug-in makes it possible to add important features that IMHO simply lacks in the RichTextEditor: 

- Load and save CLOB 
- It can remove dangerous HTML code from the CLOB or you can escaped the whole CLOB 
- If images are inserted into the RTE via Drag'nDrop or screenshots are inserted into the RTE via CTRL+V, they are loaded into the database as BLOB and only referenced in the CLOB.
